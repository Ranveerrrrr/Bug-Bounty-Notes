### Book

- **Pages:** 215-220, 220-222,222-225
- **Notes:**
  - most of the thigns where about gussing and finding patterns in password & username and single use linmk guessing
  - it was about the null value login like `improper creds validation` an attacker can put null values just empty spaces and try to login.
  - if an site uses multi stage auth doesn't mean it more secure it's more vulnerable in these expacts:
     - if uses security questions it can be brute forced if questions is repeated or question is changed
     - stages can be shifted like an attacker can shift from stage3 to stage5 skipping
