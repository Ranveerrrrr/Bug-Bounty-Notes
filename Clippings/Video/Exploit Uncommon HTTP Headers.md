## Highlights
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xmTPMDHPBo)  

Hackers abuse uncommon HTTP headers to bypass auth, rate limits, and poison caches.  
In this video, I break down real-world attacks using headers like X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP, and more. A must-watch for security researchers!

#### Rate Limit Bypass
- Rate Limit Bypass via **X-Forwarded-For** Header Manipulation on Registration Page. [Source](https://bugcrowd.com/disclosures/cbfab16a-2b3e-4a65-bf64-0e003c7c6ea7/rate-limit-bypass-via-x-forwarded-for-header-manipulation-on-registration-page)
- **Impact:** An attacker could create multiple accounts, brute force password, otp etc.

#### Auth Bypass
- When directory normally returns a 403 Forbidden HTTP status code. bypass this restriction by spoofing the "X-Forwarded-For" HTTP header and set various internal IP addresses.
- **Remediation:** X-Forwarded-For HTTP header should not be used for any Access Control List (ACL) checks because it can be spoofed by attackers. Use the real IP address for this type of restrictions.
