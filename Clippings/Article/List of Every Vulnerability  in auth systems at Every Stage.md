## Focus
Read this article if you want to know about multiple attcaks that can be done while testing login/sign up.

Treat this as the list you run **every single time** you face a login wall.

---
## Highlight
If you test login functionality long enough, you eventually hit the same wall.

You start with confidence you know dozens of login bugs.  
Logic flaws, brute force, MFA bypasses, session issues, OAuth weirdness.  
You’ve seen them before. You’ve exploited them before.

But when you actually open a real login flow:
- You try one idea
- Halfway through, another comes to mind
- You abandon the first and jump to the second
- Then a third
- Then you circle back

Not because you lack knowledge but because there are **too many attack paths** and no clear order to test them.

Authentication isn’t one vulnerability.  
It’s a **chain of states**, and attackers often fail not due to lack of skill, but due to lack of structure.

This article exists for that exact moment.

What follows is a **field-tested, systematic checklist of authentication vulnerabilities**, organized by **every meaningful stage of the login process**. It’s written for attackers who already know the techniques but want a way to **methodically test login flows without missing entire classes of bugs**.

Treat this as the list you run **every single time** you face a login wall.

# Breaking the Login Wall: A Comprehensive Guide to Authentication Vulnerabilities

> _Authentication is the first gatekeeper of any application and also one of the most consistently broken components on the web._

Login functionality looks simple on the surface: a username, a password, maybe an OTP. But under the hood, it is a **complex, multi-step system** involving user validation, session handling, rate limiting, cryptography, and trust boundaries between frontend and backend.

For attackers and bug bounty hunters alike, the login stage is a **goldmine**.

This article is a **professional, field-tested deep dive** into _every meaningful vulnerability class that can exist during authentication_, written for security engineers, bug bounty hunters, and developers who want to understand how login systems actually fail in the real world.

---

## 1. Authentication Logic Flaws (The Silent Killers)
Logic flaws are among the **most critical and most overlooked** vulnerabilities because they often require no brute force, no exploitation chain just understanding how the application thinks.

### Common Logic Failures
- Login succeeds without a password
- Password validation skipped when field is empty or null
- Username/email ignored during authentication
- Any password accepted for a valid user
- Case sensitivity mismatches (`Admin` vs `admin`)
- Trailing or leading whitespace bypass (`password ` )
- Multiple password parameters (`password=wrong&password=correct`)
- Parameter pollution (`password[]=test`)
- JSON vs form-data parsing confusion
- Trusting frontend validation (disabled JS bypass)

**Root cause:** Developers assume input arrives in one format and one order.

---

## 2. User Enumeration (Information Disclosure by Design)
User enumeration is often dismissed as low impact until it becomes the **first step of a full account takeover chain**.
### Enumeration Vectors
- Distinct error messages for invalid username vs invalid password
- Different HTTP status codes
- Different response sizes
- Noticeable response time differences
- CAPTCHA triggered only for valid users
- Account lockout applied only to existing accounts
- Password reset responses revealing account existence

**Why it matters:** Enumeration enables targeted brute force, credential stuffing, and social engineering.

---

## 3. Brute Force & Rate Limiting Failures
Authentication without proper rate limiting is an open invitation to automation.

### Common Failures
- No rate limiting at all
- Rate limiting only by IP (bypass via proxies / X-Forwarded-For)
- Rate limiting only by username
- Rate limit reset after successful login
- Parallel requests bypass thresholds
- CAPTCHA enforced only in UI, not API
- Mobile or legacy endpoints missing protection

**Pro tip:** Always test **API endpoints directly**, not just the web interface.

---

## 4. Session Management Vulnerabilities
Breaking authentication often means **breaking sessions**.
### Session Issues
- Session ID not rotated after login
- Session fixation
- Same session token before and after authentication
- Session remains valid after logout
- Session usable across devices
- Sessions never expire
- Predictable or weak session tokens
- JWT not invalidated on logout
- Weak JWT signing secret
- `alg:none` or algorithm confusion

**Impact:** Full account takeover without credentials.

---

## 5. MFA / 2FA Bypass Techniques
Multi-Factor Authentication frequently fails due to **partial implementation**.
### Real-World MFA Flaws
- MFA enforced only in frontend
- MFA endpoint directly accessible
- OTP not bound to session or user
- OTP reuse allowed
- No rate limiting on OTP attempts
- MFA skipped on specific login flows
- Remember-me tokens bypass MFA
- Backup codes reusable or predictable
- MFA disabled via parameter tampering

**Key insight:** MFA is a _state machine_. Break the state, break the security.

---

## 6. Password Reset & Account Recovery Vulnerabilities
Password reset is often **less protected than login itself**.
### Critical Reset Issues
- Tokens not single-use
- Tokens never expire
- Predictable reset tokens
- Tokens not bound to user or session
- Password reset allows email change
- Reset works on disabled accounts
- Old reset links remain valid
- Host header injection in reset emails

**Severity:** These issues frequently lead to full account compromise.

---

## 7. Account Lockout Logic Errors
Account lockout is meant to stop attackers — but poor logic often makes it useless.
### Lockout Bypasses
- Lockout resets after successful login
- Lockout bypass via IP rotation
- Lockout applies only to password, not OTP
- Lockout enforced only in UI
- Lockout counters reset improperly

---

## 8. OAuth & SSO Authentication Vulnerabilities
Third-party authentication introduces **new trust assumptions** — and new attack surfaces.
### OAuth/SSO Issues
- Missing or unvalidated `state` parameter
- Login CSRF
- OAuth account misbinding
- Email not verified in OAuth response
- Attacker linking their OAuth account to victim
- Open redirects in OAuth flow
- Weak redirect URI validation

---

## 9. Input Handling & Edge-Case Exploits
Edge cases are where real bugs hide.
### Advanced Tests
- Unicode normalization issues
- Extremely long input values
- Null bytes (`%00`)
- Emojis in credentials
- Switching HTTP methods
- Mixed content types (JSON + form)
- Concurrent login attempts
- Logging in during password reset flow

---

## 10. Why Login Vulnerabilities Still Exist
Despite years of awareness, login vulnerabilities persist because:
- Developers underestimate complexity
- Security is added late, not designed in
- APIs are secured differently than UIs
- Edge cases are rarely tested

---
## Final Thoughts
Authentication is not a feature it is an **attack surface**.

If you are a bug bounty hunter, treat login flows as **multi-step systems**, not single endpoints.  
If you are a developer, assume every input will be malformed, replayed, and abused.

The login page is not the front door.  
It is the entire building.

## 1. Authentication Logic Flaws (The Silent Killers)
Logic flaws are among the **most critical and most overlooked** vulnerabilities because they often require no brute force, no exploitation chain just understanding how the application thinks.

### Common Logic Failures
- Login succeeds without a password
- Password validation skipped when field is empty or null
- Username/email ignored during authentication
- Any password accepted for a valid user
- Case sensitivity mismatches (`Admin` vs `admin`)
- Trailing or leading whitespace bypass (`password ` )
- Multiple password parameters (`password=wrong&password=correct`)
- Parameter pollution (`password[]=test`)
- JSON vs form-data parsing confusion
- Trusting frontend validation (disabled JS bypass)

### Expanded Attack Vectors (Common & Advanced)
- **Type Juggling Attacks (PHP-specific)**: Submitting `password=0` might match a hashed password starting with `0e` (e.g., `0e123...`) due to loose comparison `==` operators
- **SQL Injection via Login**: Using `admin'--` or `admin' OR '1'='1` in username/password if inputs are concatenated directly into SQL queries
- **NoSQL Injection**: For MongoDB-based auth, using `{"$gt": ""}` or `{"$ne": null}` in JSON parameters to bypass checks
- **LDAP Injection**: Injecting `*` or `)(&)` into LDAP search filters for authentication bypass
- **Implicit Authentication Trust**: Assuming a valid session cookie means the user is authenticated, without verifying it against the server's session store
- **Cookie Manipulation**: Changing `logged_in=false` to `true` or `role=user` to `role=admin` in client-side cookies
- **Path Traversal in Login**: Using `../` in username fields to potentially interfere with server-side file operations
- **HTTP Parameter Contamination**: Adding extra parameters that override previous ones (`user=admin&user=attacker`)
- **Content-Type Switching**: Sending `application/xml` or `text/plain` instead of expected `application/json` to trigger different parsers
- **API Version Bypass**: Accessing unsecured legacy API endpoints (`/v1/login` vs secured `/v2/login`)

**Root cause:** Developers assume input arrives in one format and one order, trust client-side state, and fail to implement consistent server-side validation.

### 📌 Real-World Report Examples
- **HackerOne Report**: Login bypass on a popular CMS via password reset parameter tampering allowing admin access without credentials
- **Bugcrowd Report**: Authentication bypass in fintech app by adding `?admin=true` to post-login redirect
- **Medium Article**: How changing `Accept-Language` header bypassed authentication in a multinational corporation's portal

## 2. User Enumeration (Information Disclosure by Design)
User enumeration is often dismissed as low impact until it becomes the **first step of a full account takeover chain**.

### Enumeration Vectors
- Distinct error messages for invalid username vs invalid password
- Different HTTP status codes
- Different response sizes
- Noticeable response time differences
- CAPTCHA triggered only for valid users
- Account lockout applied only to existing accounts
- Password reset responses revealing account existence

### Expanded Enumeration Techniques
- **Timing Attacks**: Measuring response time differences (valid users may trigger database lookups adding milliseconds)
- **Browser Cache Differences**: Valid vs invalid user pages might be cached differently
- **Error Message Distinctions**: `Your password is incorrect` vs `Invalid credentials` (still reveals user existence)
- **Password Policy Leaks**: "Password too short" only appears when username is valid and password field is checked against policy
- **Session Token Generation**: Some apps generate session tokens pre-authentication for valid users only
- **Email/SMS Rate Limit Differences**: Sending password reset to valid users might hit rate limits faster
- **Third-Party Integration Leaks**: Social login buttons (Google/Facebook) might only show for registered users
- **CAPTCHA Behavior**: CAPTCHA appears after X failed attempts on valid user, immediately on invalid user
- **HTTP Header Variations**: Different `Set-Cookie`, `Location`, or `Cache-Control` headers
- **Resource Loading Differences**: Different CSS/JS files loaded for login error pages vs password reset pages

**Why it matters:** Enumeration enables targeted brute force, credential stuffing, and social engineering campaigns with significantly higher success rates.

### 📌 Real-World Report Examples
- **HackerOne Report**: User enumeration via password reset function on a government portal returning different HTTP status codes
- **Bugcrowd Report**: Timing attack on a healthcare application revealing valid patient usernames (2ms difference measurable)
- **Medium Article**: Exploiting React component state differences to enumerate users in a single-page application

### Expanded Brute Force Techniques
- **Distributed Brute Force**: Using botnets or multiple VPN endpoints to distribute attempts
- **Slow Brute Force**: Spreading attempts over days/weeks to avoid detection
- **Credential Stuffing**: Using leaked credentials from other breaches (most users reuse passwords)
- **Password Spraying**: Trying a few common passwords against many users instead of many passwords against few users

## Final Thoughts
Authentication is not a feature it is an **attack surface**.

If you are a bug bounty hunter, treat login flows as **multi-step systems**, not single endpoints. Map every state transition, test every parameter, and chain small flaws into critical impacts.

If you are a developer, assume every input will be malformed, replayed, and abused. Implement defense in depth: validate early, use strong cryptography, maintain state server-side, and audit logs meticulously.

If you are a security tester, think like both an attacker and a developer. Understand the business logic behind authentication flows. Test not just for standard vulnerabilities but for logic that can be abused.

The login page is not the front door.  
It is the entire building — and attackers will check every window, vent, and delivery entrance.
