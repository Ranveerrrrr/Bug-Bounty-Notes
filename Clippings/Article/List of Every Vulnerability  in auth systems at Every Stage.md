Read this article if you want to know about multiple attcaks that can be done while testing login/sign up.

If you test login functionality long enough, you eventually hit the same wall.

You start with confidence you know dozens of login bugs.  
Logic flaws, brute force, MFA bypasses, session issues, OAuth weirdness.  
You’ve seen them before. You’ve exploited them before.

But when you actually open a real login flow:
- You try one idea
- Halfway through, another comes to mind
- You abandon the first and jump to the second
- Then a third
- Then you circle back

Not because you lack knowledge but because there are **too many attack paths** and no clear order to test them.

Authentication isn’t one vulnerability.  
It’s a **chain of states**, and attackers often fail not due to lack of skill, but due to lack of structure.

This article exists for that exact moment.

What follows is a **field-tested, systematic checklist of authentication vulnerabilities**, organized by **every meaningful stage of the login process**. It’s written for attackers who already know the techniques but want a way to **methodically test login flows without missing entire classes of bugs**.

Treat this as the list you run **every single time** you face a login wall.
