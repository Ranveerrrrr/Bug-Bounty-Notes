## One-line definition
<!-- If you can’t define it in one line, stop -->
This is a vulnerability when an vulnerable site accepts requests coming from other origin and not the site itself
## Preconditions
<!-- Auth state, cache headers, victim behavior -->
CSRF Headers, token
## Core idea (logic, not steps)
<!-- What breaks in trust or logic -->
this vulnerability occures when an vulnerable site accepts request comng from other sites to and does not validate it like a password change form is created and submitted to the vulnerable site and it will accept it without valdiating where the request is coming from and will change password of the user whgo clicked just a link and automatically his account can be takeover 
## Where it actually works
<!-- APIs, static endpoints, edge caches -->
when any changes are being made in user profile but has many more wildcard where it can be critical
- changing password
- changing username, number, email, profile links
- posting anything like comment
- profile picture change, etc
- any where where user input is taken and its critical and no csrf or any other token is there
## Why it’s dangerous
<!-- What attacker gains in practice -->
can lead to #Bugs/ato 
## Common failure points
<!-- Why it usually fails -->
where csrf token or any other token exist in request or site refuse to accept the request 
## Detection mindset
<!-- What clues tell me to try this while hacking -->
look for request user input or anychange is made in site and try;
- removing csrf, token etc if exist
- give invalid token (gibbrish)
- take token of other user and try injecting in the csrf poc form
- can make a get request with something like delete and it will work if opened trough terminal or opened anyway by victim
## Variations / chains
<!-- How this connects to other attacks -->
can lead to ato
