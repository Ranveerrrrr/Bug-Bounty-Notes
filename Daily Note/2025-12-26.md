# Today Learned About
### Java/Flash/Silverlight Serialization
The Java language contains native support for object serialization, and Java applets may use this to send serialized data structures between the client and server application components. Messages containing serialized Java objects usually can be identifi ed because they have the following Content-Type header:
```Java-Serialization
Content-Type: application/x-java-serialized-object
```
```Flash-Serialization
Content-Type: application/x-amf
```
```Silverlight-Serialization
Content-Type: application/soap+msbin1
```
Vulnerable:-
#Red-flag/Java-Serialization Could be deserialized with [Dser](http://blog.andlabs.org/2010/09/re-visiting-java-de-serialization-it.html) Plugin in Burp.
#Red-flag/Flash-Searialization nativley supported by Burp.
#Red-flag/Sliverlight-Searialization Plugin also exist.

## [AWS Cognito Error](../Attacks/AWS%20S3%20Misconfigration.md) #Bugs/aws-s3 
If a website using aws cognito for sensative processes like sign-up, regestring etc when the work is done the server provides a **ACCESS_TOKEN** that Token can be used in aws cli itself like given below:
https://hackerone.com/reports/1342088

In this report with context here:
on a platform where email change is not allowed after account creation
the attacker saw that the website was using aws cognito in backend to store the user data and he realized that aws cli allows changing with the **ACCESS_TOKEN** in cli email could be change with the cli and ATO was possible.

learned a new javascript new protoype [docs of String.prototype.search()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/search) it considers the string value in it as regex rather than just a string so when doing a sensative task of compering the domain if whitelisted to be framed it should not  use this as for the regax pattern these both ar same:
digit.com === d.igit.com

The (.) acts as a wildcard
